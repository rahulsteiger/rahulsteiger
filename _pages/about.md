I am a Master's student in Data Science at ETH Zurich, with a strong interest in the intersection of High-Performance Computing and Machine Learning. Currently, I am working as an Applied Research Intern at Thomson Reuters Labs in Zug, where I am currently collaborating with a team of research engineers to develop an internal tool that streamlines hosting open-source LLMs for researchers.

In 2024, I participated in a five-month exchange program at the National University of Singapore and completed a four-month research internship at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology under the mentorship of Prof. Makoto Yamada. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. During my studies, I was an active member of [Team RACKlette](https://racklette.ethz.ch/), representing the university in international student cluster competitions.
